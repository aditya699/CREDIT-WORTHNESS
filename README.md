# CREDIT-WORTHNESS
This is a application that uses a pipeline deployed as a rest endpoint and helps one make real time predictions

🔥 Making the most of Azure ML Studio 🔥 



# 1. Azure ML Studio is a game changing cloud-based platform 🌤 that eliminates the need for large IT infrastructures and enables rapid development of predictive models 🤓. 



# 2.With its host of powerful tools and features, it allows for easy cleaning, transforming and modeling of data. Plus, it's incredibly straightforward to deploy an endpoint and use it to make predictions in near real-time 🚀.  



I  recently developed an Azure ML Studio-based pipeline to determine creditworthiness 💱 with great accuracy and speed. With Azure ML Studio, we were able to quickly clean and transform the data, build an effective and robust model, and then deploy it as an endpoint. All this was made possible without having to worry about managing an entire IT infrastructure or dealing with complex coding requirements!   I believe that leveraging the power of Azure ML Studio 💡 is the way forward for any organization that needs to quickly develop reliable predictive models and make predictions in near real-time.
